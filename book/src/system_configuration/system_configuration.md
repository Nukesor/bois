# System management

`bois` has been designed to be used for system configuration from the very start.

On top of configuration file management, it also supports:

- [Package management](./package_management/package_management.md)
  - Specify the exact set of packages that should be installed via various system package managers.
  - Automatically un-/install packages when changes in the `bois` configuration have taken place.
- Service management
  - Enable/Disable services via configuration
