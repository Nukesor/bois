## Checklist

Please make sure the PR adheres to this project's standards:

- [ ] I included a new entry to the `CHANGELOG.md`.
- [ ] I checked `cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt`. The CI will fail otherwise anyway.
- [ ] (If applicable) I went through the books to see if anything needed changing or adding and made the updates as needed.
